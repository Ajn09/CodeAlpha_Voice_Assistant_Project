The Hellona Voice Assistant project is an AI-powered voice assistant built using Python programming language. It utilizes various libraries and APIs to provide a range of functionalities, including:

Voice Recognition: The assistant can recognize and interpret voice commands spoken by the user using the SpeechRecognition library.

Text-to-Speech: It can respond to user queries by converting text output into spoken words using the pyttsx3 library.

Wikipedia Search: Users can ask the assistant to search for information on Wikipedia by providing a query, and the assistant retrieves relevant summaries from Wikipedia articles.

News Headlines: The assistant can fetch and read out the latest news headlines using the News API, providing users with up-to-date information.

Web Browsing: Users can instruct the assistant to perform web searches by specifying search queries, and the assistant opens the default web browser to display search results.

File Management: The assistant can open the file explorer or command prompt on the user's system, allowing them to navigate files and directories.

Opening Applications: Users can command the assistant to open specific applications installed on their system, such as web browsers, code editors, or media players.

Playing Music: The assistant can play music files stored in a designated directory, providing users with a convenient way to listen to their favorite songs.

YouTube Playback: Users can ask the assistant to play videos from YouTube by specifying search queries, and the assistant opens the default web browser to play the selected video.

Sending Messages: The assistant can send WhatsApp messages to specified contacts at scheduled times using the pywhatkit library.

The Hellona Voice Assistant project aims to provide users with a hands-free, intuitive way to interact with their computer and access information, perform tasks, and control applications using natural language commands. It demonstrates the integration of various Python libraries and APIs to create a functional voice assistant with voice recognition, text-to-speech, and AI capabilities.
